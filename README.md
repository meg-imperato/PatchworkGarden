# PatchworkGarden
Interactive Digital Artwork Inspired by Shelley Jackson's 'Patchwork Girl'
   * Goals: explore non-linear story telling through the cyclical nature of a garden, 
   create an interactive space where the user can explore the narritive out of order,
   play with the binary of life and death, show the transition from created to creator,
   use a variety of methods to illustrate a point in a story: annimation, poetry, symbolism, etc.
